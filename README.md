== Obi Remove Post Types from Search
Ever needed to exclude posts from a post type from the WordPress search feature? This plugin helps you with just that.  
Upon activation, in the plugin settings you'll find a list of all the public (custom) post types registered on your website.  
The ones search-enabled will have a checkbox ticked on.  
You can remove them simply by unticking the corresponding checkbox and save the changes.  

This is a work in progress. The main functionality still is not part of the plugin.
